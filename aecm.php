    <h1 style="color:gold">ABOUT VIIT</h1>
    <p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:22px;color:aliceblue">Vignan's Institute of Information Technology (VIIT) was
     established in 2002 in the City of Destiny, Visakhapatnam, to cater to the educational needs of the general public. 
     It acquired Autonomous status in the year 2017 and NBA and NAAC(A+) accredited Institute. The experience gained by 
     Vignan through its earlier institutions at Guntur has only 
    helped in establishing very high quality standards right from the inception and also is one of the reasons for the success.</p>
